# 3 body Problem

# Features
## Controls
Click on the Control panel on the right in order to control the simulation. You can pause/play, reset, wind (jump ahead or back in time), have the camera follow a ball, and add/remove balls.
There is also the option to enable acceleration clipping, as without it, things would get slingshotted into infinity.

## Body editing
All properties (position, velocity, acceleration, color, mass, and radius) are editable! Attempting to do so will pause the simulation, and you can then press play to see your changes!


# Todo:
- fix keep trails on reload bodies
